## Gif of your breadboard LED in action

## Outline of Plan
We would build a circuit to turn on or off the LED. The cool part is that the LED would gradually get brighter or darker. Besides, turning on and off
are controlled by the keyboard. 

The circuit we propose is shown below.

## Components
1. 1 100uF capacitor

2. 1 STP16NF06 MOSFET

3. 2 750 Ohmn resistors

4. 1 lighting LED

## Questions
We do not know what should be the best parameters for the components. We may need to try different resistors and capacitors.
